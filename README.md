# Creator Social Token

The creator economy is growing more than ever, with Instagram and Tiktok being one of the largest platforms for creators. At the same time, many artists are taking advantage of NFTs to create and build a community around their art.

As the creator economy receives more attention, there has also been a rise in the adoption of social tokens. However, many creators who would love to create social tokens don't know how to write smart contracts or which tools to use. 

Therefore, I wanted to make it easy for fans to gift creators and also for creators to reward their fans. At the same time, further, solve the UX problem in crypto by creating little to no barrier for creators who would like to reward their loyal fans with social tokens.

## What it does
It helps loyal fans support their favorite creators and allow creators to reward their fans with social tokens. These tokens would give loyal fans special access to the creator's content.
